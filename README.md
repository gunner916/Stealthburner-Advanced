# Stealthburner-Advanced
Additional Stealthburner variants.

This was made with the goal of my V2.4595 getting a Dragon WHF and running a AVC DFTA0456B2H using CPAP tubing.
The fan was used as a core to create a 6535 Turbine as a cheaper alternative to the traditional blowers used by the VZbot.
With those goals in mind I intend to cover a few other use cases as well trying to keep the original SB style intact in the process.

Current progress....
-Main body keeping the full SB size and estimated to be SB2040 compatible (verification would be awesome!)
-Airway complete for CPAP tube both 19mm and 15mm. (Personally had 19mm tubing available)
-LED being moved was given a new part but reuses the mask and diffuser from the main repo

Future improvements intended.....
-BETTER ORGINAZTION HERE LOL!
-STEP files for LED front and future nameplate spot for easier custom parts for the faceplate.
-Nozzle cam support (really looking forward to this one)
-A reduced Y sapce faceplate to makeup for TAP offset (however finding this may require modified hotend part or watercooling)

I am a stay at home dad and took a lot of interest in 3d printing over the past few years, exspensive hobby when the wife determines expendatures LOL!
So if any of these projects are helpful and interesting any donations to cover more filament would be greatly appreciated, cashapp $seankodweis.
